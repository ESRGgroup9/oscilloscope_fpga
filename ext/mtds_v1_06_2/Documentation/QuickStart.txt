Welcome to the Multi-Touch Display System (MTDS)! This download contains 
libraries for your MTDS display along with their associated documentation and 
demos. It includes two libraries:
 
mtds   - A complete set of functions for graphics processing, touch handling, 
         and more.
MyDisp - A very easy to use library built on the mtds library that simplifies
         designing embedded GUIs.

This document includes a quick overview of the contents of this download and a
guide to help you get started running the included Multi-Touch Display System 
example demos.


File Contents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Documentation
   *Complete Documentation for the two libraries, an errata document, and this 
    guide.

*Libraries
   *Source code for the mtds and MyDisp libraries
   
*Resources
   *Helpful images for demos and drawing GUIs. The BmpLib folder has useful 
    images that can be used as buttons, switches, and indicators. The Images 
    folder includes several images used by the mtds example demos. 
	
*Sketches
   *The MyDisp and mtds example sketches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------   


Pre-requisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* An MTDS supported display platform 
   *See https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/software/mtds/start
    for a list of supported platforms
	
* An Arduino (or chipKIT) compatible host platform

* A computer with Arduino IDE (or MPIDE) installed and configured to work
  correctly with your host platform
  
* A FAT formatted microSD card
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Copy the contents of the Resources folder to the microSD card. The microSD 
   card should now have two folders titled "BmpLib" and "Images" in its base
   directory. 
   
   WARNING: The microSD card should not contain the Resources folder or else
            the example demos will not run correctly.

2) Insert the microSD card into the MTDS display platform.

3) Install the mtds and MyDisp libraries by copying the contents of the Libraries 
   folder into the libraries folder inside your sketchbook for Arduino IDE.
   
4) Copy the contents of the Sketches folder into your Arduino IDE sketchbook. 

5) Attach the display platform to your host platform, then connect your host 
   platform to your computer via USB.

6) Open up Arduino IDE, select your host platform, and begin running through the
   mtds and MyDisp example sketches. We recommend starting with the MyDisp 
   examples, as that library is very easy to use and should provide enough
   functionality for most use cases.
